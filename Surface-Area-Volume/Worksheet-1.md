## Section A: Basic Application (Easy)

### A1
CSA of hemisphere = 2πr²  
= 2 × 22/7 × 7 × 7  
= 308 m²  

Cost = 308 × 5  
= **₹1540**

---

### A2
Slant height,  
l = √(3² + 4²) = 5 m  

CSA of cone = πrl  
= 22/7 × 3 × 5  
= **47.14 m²**

---

### A3
CSA of hemisphere  
= 2πr²  
= 2 × 22/7 × 14 × 14  
= **1232 cm²**

---

### A4
CSA of sphere  
= 4πr²  
= 4 × 22/7 × 3.5 × 3.5  
= **154 cm²**

---

### A5
CSA of hemisphere  
= 2πr²  
= 2 × 22/7 × 7 × 7  
= **308 cm²**

---

## Section B: Moderate

### A6
CSA of cone  
= πrl  
= 22/7 × 7 × 25  
= **550 cm²**

---

### A7
TSA of hemisphere  
= 3πr²  
= 3 × 22/7 × 7 × 7  
= **462 cm²**

---

### A8
Slant height,  
l = √(5² + 12²) = 13 cm  

TSA of cone  
= πr(l + r)  
= 22/7 × 5 × (13 + 5)  
= **396.43 cm²**

---

### A9
TSA of sphere  
= 4πr²  
= 4 × 22/7 × 6 × 6  
= **452.57 cm²**

---

### A10
CSA of hemisphere  
= 2πr²  
= 2 × 22/7 × 10 × 10  
= **628.57 cm²**

---

## Section C: Volume & Recasting 

### A11
(1/3)π × 7² × 24 = (4/3)πR³  

R³ = 294  
R ≈ **6.63 cm**

---

### A12
(4/3)π × 7³ = (1/3)π × 7² × h  

h = **28 cm**

---

### A13
(2/3)π × 6³ = (4/3)πR³  

R³ = 108

---

### A17
Surface area ratio = **1 : 4**

---

### A18
h = 4r  

Required ratio = **4 : 1**

---

## Section E: Higher order thinking questions

### A19
(4/3)πR³ = 2 × (1/3)π × (R/2)² × h  

h = **8R**

---
